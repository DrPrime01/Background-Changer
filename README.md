# Background-Changer
 A background changer using rgb
 The project is inspired by a 100 JavaScript projects challenge I came across.
 The first project was to create a background changer using loops to pick already written colors in a list. However, I decided to modify mine using Math.floor(Math.random * 265) to randomly pick a number between 0 and 255 and use it as an RGB value.

 Feel free to add your suggestions.
